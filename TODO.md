# Teenie ToDo — Upcoming Features

## Core Usability
- [ ] Edit todo text (fix typos without delete/re-add)
- [ ] Rename a list from the UI (backend thunk exists)
- [ ] Delete a list from the UI (backend thunk exists)
- [ ] Reorder todos (drag-to-reorder; `sort_order` column exists)
- [ ] Clear completed todos (bulk action)
- [ ] Improve checkbox tap feedback on mobile (visual press state so toggling feels responsive)
- [ ] Add undo toast when toggling a todo (let users quickly reverse accidental taps)

## Sharing Improvements
- [ ] Show who a list is currently shared with (visible to list owner)
- [ ] Distinguish owned vs shared lists in the sidebar
- [ ] Share via link (in addition to email-based sharing)
- [ ] Confirm sharing email is sent

## Routing / Deployment
- [ ] Fix 404 on direct URL access / page refresh (e.g. `/list/:id`) — need to configure Vercel SPA fallback rewrites

## Analytics
